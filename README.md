# Ventriloquy
#### CS 130 Project

  Ventriloquy is a web-based application that will allow users to generate spoken words from famous figures’ voices. This will be useful for people creating chatbots based upon celebrities. Our users will be developers who wish to tap into our API, and we will have a website they can visit for demonstrations of the technology.

  We also wish for this project to call attention to the advancement of technology and its implications upon society. Currently, voice-recorded audio is considered good evidence in court, but as this technology advances, it shouldn’t be. Unfortunately, if the general public is not aware of this shift, the change in court attitude on voice-recorded audio is unlikely to occur. Therefore, we see this project as a social tool to aid and inform the public on the advances of this technology.
